# Zed's Plugin Runner
Wasm plugins can be run through `wasmtime`, with supported for sandboxed system integration through WASI. There are three `plugin` crates that implement different things:

1. `plugin_runtime` loads and runs compiled `Wasm` plugins, and handles setting up system bindings.

2. `plugin` is the crate that Rust Wasm plugins should depend on. It re-exports some required crates (e.g. `serde`, `bincode`) and provides some necessary macros for generating bindings that `plugin_runtime` can hook into.

3. `plugin_macros` implements the proc macros required by `plugin`, like the `#[bind]` attribute macro.

## ABI
The interface between the host Rust runtime ('Runtime') and plugins implemented in Wasm ('Plugin') is pretty simple.

`Buffer` is a pair of two 4-byte (`u32`) fields, encoded as a single `u64`.

```
struct Buffer {
    ptr: u32,
    len: u32,
}
```

All functions that Plugin exports must have the following properties:

- Have the signature `fn(ptr: u64) -> u64`, where both the argument and return types are a `Buffer`:

    - The input `Buffer` will contain the input arguments serialized to `bincode`.
    - The output `Buffer` will contain the output arguments serialized to `bincode`.

- Have a name starting with two underscores.

Additionally, Plugin must export an:

- `__alloc_buffer` function that, given a `u32` length, returns a `u32` pointer to a buffer of that length.

Note that all of these requirements are automatically fullfilled for any Rust Wasm plugin that uses the `plugin` crate, and imports the `prelude`. 

Here's an example Rust Wasm plugin that doubles the value of every float in a `Vec<f64>` passed into it:

```rust
use plugin::prelude::*;

#[export]
pub fn double(mut x: Vec<f64>) -> Vec<f64> {
    x.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2.0).collect()
}
```

All the serialization code is automatically generated by `#[export]`.

You can specify functions that must be defined host-side by using the `#[import]` attribute. This attribute must be attached to a function signature:

```rust
#[import]
fn run(command: String) -> Vec<u8>;
```

The `#[import]` macro will generate a function body that performs the proper serialization/deserialization needed to call out to the host rust runtime. Note that the same ABI is used for both `#[import]` and `#[export]`.
