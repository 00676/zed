Mention a language model with / at the start of any line, like this:

/ Please help me articulate Zed's approach to integrating with LLMs.

> Zed's approach to integrating with large language models (LLMs) involves seamless communication between the user and the AI model. By incorporating a mention with a / at the beginning of a line, users can directly ask questions or request assistance from the AI model. This provides an interactive and efficient way to collaborate within the editor, enhancing productivity and supporting user needs. <

This document serves as both the context for AI model invocation and as a representation of an ongoing conversation between the users and the model. Zed supports lightweight branching and merging of these contexts. As users query the model, then integrate changes based on its response, we maintain a history relating every model output to the evolving document.

/ What are the benefits of doing this?

> The benefits of integrating AI models in this manner include:
1. Streamlined workflow: Users can maintain a continuous interaction with the model while working on a document, eliminating the need to switch between tools.
2. Improved collaboration: The approach allows multiple users to collaborate with the AI model, enhancing the collective decision-making process.
3. Context-aware assistance: As the document serves as the context, the AI model is able to understand the evolving context and provide more relevant and informed suggestions.
4. Transparency: Maintaining a history of the model's outputs in connection with the document ensures that the conversation remains transparent and traceable, facilitating better understanding between users and the AI.
5. Flexibility: Lightweight branching and merging allow users to experiment with different ideas and incorporate the most appropriate suggestions from the AI model. <
