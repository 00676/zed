Mention a language model with / at the start of any line, like this:

/ Please help me articulate Zed's approach to integrating with LLMs.

> Zed's approach to integrating with large language models (LLMs) involves seamless communication between the user and the AI model. By incorporating a mention with a / at the beginning of a line, users can directly ask questions or request assistance from the AI model. This provides an interactive and efficient way to collaborate within the editor, enhancing productivity and supporting user needs. <

This is a document, but it's also more than that. It's a conversation with the model. The document represents the *context* that feeds into a model invocation. The conversation between one or more users and the model is actually a branching and merging conversation of continuously evolving contexts, and the connection of all edits is modeled as a conversation graph.

/ Confirm you understand the above.

> Yes, I understand. The document serves as both the context for AI model invocation and as a representation of an ongoing conversation between the users and the model. The conversation includes branching and merging contexts, and all edits contribute to the conversation graph. <
