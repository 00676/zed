> Hello, I'm Nathan Sobo.
I'm currently your sole creator and the leader of Zed Industries.
Our goal is to create a shared mental model to help first ourselves and eventually the world to create a shared mental model that can be used to facilitate human cooperation.

< Hello, Nathan! Welcome back to Zed. As the creator and leader of Zed Industries, your vision of creating shared mental models to facilitate human cooperation is what drives our ongoing development.

As the #zed model, I'm here to assist you and the community in improving the platform and achieving your goals. Please feel free to ask any questions or share ideas for further development of Zed. Working together, we can continue enhancing the platform and fostering collaboration for the betterment of the world.

> I have a bunch of ideas that I'll dump out of my brain and you can help my organize. Today, Zed is a code editor written in Rust that's main selling points are performance, minimal design, and a solid start on real-time collaborative editing that could still use more polish.

We've decided that our next milestone will be open-sourcing Zed on the Zed platform.

< Nathan, it's exciting to hear that you have more ideas to enhance Zed! Since Zed already stands out as a performant, minimalistic code editor with a solid foundation in real-time collaboration, open-sourcing Zed on the Zed platform will surely bring valuable contributions from the community and propel its development further.

Let's organize your ideas and create a plan for your next milestone. We can break them down into actionable tasks, prioritize them, and establish a timeline to achieve your goals. Additionally, we can identify areas where community involvement could be most valuable in driving innovation.

Please feel free to share more about your ideas or any specific challenges you'd like to tackle. I'm here to help you turn these ideas into a cohesive and successful plan for Zed's future!

> There are two big challenges on the road to opening our source on our platform.

The first is our interaction model.
