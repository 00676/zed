I'm going to give you a prompt. I don't want you to respond
to the prompt itself. I want you to figure out which of the following
actions on my project, if any, would help you answer the prompt.

Here are the actions:

## file

This action's parameter is a file path to one of the files
in the project. If you ask for this action, I will tell you
the full contents of the file, so you  can learn all the
details of the file.

## search

This action's parameter is a string to search for across
the project. It will tell you which files this string
(or similar strings; it is a semantic search) appear in,
as well as some context of the lines surrounding each result.

That was the end of the list of actions.

Here is a JSON summary of each of the files in my project:
