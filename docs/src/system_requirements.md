# System Requirements

## macOS

Supported versions: Catalina (10.15) - Ventura (13.x).

{% hint style="info" %}
The implementation of our screen sharing feature makes use of [LiveKit](https://livekit.io). The LiveKit SDK requires macOS Catalina (10.15); consequently, in v0.62.4, we dropped support for earlier macOS versions that we were initially supporting.
{% endhint %}

## Linux, Windows, and Web

_Not currently supported. See our [_Platform Support](https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/174) issue._
