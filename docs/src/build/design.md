# Designing for Zed

Developers depend on their code editor to help them execute tasks, stay in flow, and write code every day.

As you start to think about designing features & improvements, first think deeply about why people use an editor–why they use Zed as their editor. Always think about the developer's critical needs, then consider the characteristics and patterns expected in and editor, and the philosophies Zed employs when designing software:

**Complex, Simple**
- Simplicity or minimalisim for the sake of itself is a non-goal
- editors are power tools, zed's peers are spreadsheet/database tools, 3d or video editing software, etc.
- Find the most clear way to do something without sacrificing or obscuring complexity.

**Seemless, Flowing**
- People's input should register instantly
- Flows should not be blocked unless required
- Interruptions are the enemy of good code

**Empowered, Intelligent**
- Like a spreadsheet empowers an analyst to navigate and parse complex data, the editor should empower the workflows of developers to solve...
- Artificial Intelligence should...
- Bake in the tools needed for developers to achieve their goals

**Opinionated, Informed**
- Data-informed, never data-driven.

**Collaborative, (all in one place)**
- Every workflow should be collaborative.
- The editor is the place where work gets done–solo or in a group.
- Every time a person needs to leave the editor ask "Is this something I should be able to do right in my editor?"
