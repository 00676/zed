# Diagrams

The SVG sequence diagrams in the `svg` folder are generated from the UML text files in the `src` folder. To regenerate them, run `script/generate-doc-diagrams`.

Documentation for the UML sequence diagram format is located on [the PlantUML website](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram).
