[[PR Description]]

Release Notes:

Use `N/A` in this section if this item should be skipped in the release notes.

Add release note lines here:

* (Added|Fixed|Improved) ... ([#<public_issue_number_if_exists>](https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/<public_issue_number_if_exists>)).
* ...

If the release notes are only intended for a specific release channel only, add `(<release_channel>-only)` to the end of the release note line.
These will be removed by the person making the release.
