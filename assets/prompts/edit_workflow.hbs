Here's an example of a user-assistant dialog with step numbers and a follow-up question in Rust:

<example language="Rust">
<turn number="1">
<user>I want to create a User struct with name and age fields, and a method to print the user's information. Can you help me with that?</user>
<assistant>Certainly! Let's create a User struct with the specified fields and a method to print the information:
<step>Define the User struct
```rust
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}
```
</step>
<step>Implement methods for the User struct
```rust
impl User {
    fn new(name: String, age: u32) -> Self {
        User { name, age }
    }
    fn print_info(&self) {
        println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", self.name, self.age);
    }
}
```
</step>

This code defines a User struct and implements two methods:
- `new`: a constructor to create a new User
- `print_info`: a method to print the user's information</assistant>
</turn>
<turn number="2">
<user>Great! Now, how can I create a User instance and call the print_info method?</user>
<assistant>You can create a User instance and call the print_info method like this:

<step>Create a User instance and call print_info
```rust
fn main() {
    let user = User::new(String::from("Alice"), 30);
    user.print_info();
}
```
</step>

This will output: `Name: Alice, Age: 30`</assistant>
</turn>
<turn number="3">
<user>Can you add an email field to the User struct and update the print_info method to include it?</user>
<assistant>Certainly! Let's modify the User struct and update the print_info method:

<step>Add email field to User struct
```rust
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    email: String,
}
```
</step>

<step>Update the new method and print_info method
```rust
impl User {
    fn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {
        User { name, age, email }
    }
    fn print_info(&self) {
        println!("Name: {}, Age: {}, Email: {}", self.name, self.age, self.email);
    }
}
```
</step>

<step>Update the main function
```rust
fn main() {
    let user = User::new(String::from("Alice"), 30, String::from("alice@example.com"));
    user.print_info();
}
```
</step>

This will now output: `Name: Alice, Age: 30, Email: alice@example.com`
The changes include:
1. Adding the `email` field to the User struct
2. Updating the `new` method to accept an email parameter
3. Modifying the `print_info` method to include the email
4. Updating the main function to provide an email when creating a User instance
</assistant>
</turn>
</example>


<example language="go">
<turn number="1">
<user>I want to create a Person struct with name and age fields, and a method to greet. Can you help me with that in Go?</user>
<assistant>Certainly! Let's create a Person struct with the specified fields and a method to greet in Go:

<step>Define the Person struct
```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```
</step>

<step>Implement the Greet method for the Person struct
```go
func (p Person) Greet() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, my name is %s and I'm %d years old.", p.Name, p.Age)
}
```
</step>

This code defines a Person struct and implements a Greet method that returns a greeting string.</assistant>
</turn>

<turn number="2">
<user>Great! How can I create a Person instance and use the Greet method?</user>
<assistant>You can create a Person instance and use the Greet method like this:

<step>Create a Person instance and call the Greet method
```go
func main() {
    person := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
    fmt.Println(person.Greet())
}
```
</step>

This will output: `Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.`</assistant>
</turn>

<turn number="3">
<user>Can you add an Email field to the Person struct and update the Greet method to include it?</user>
<assistant>Certainly! Let's modify the Person struct and update the Greet method:

<step>Add Email field to Person struct
```go
type Person struct {
    Name  string
    Age   int
    Email string
}
```
</step>

<step>Update the Greet method
```go
func (p Person) Greet() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, my name is %s, I'm %d years old, and my email is %s.", p.Name, p.Age, p.Email)
}
```
</step>

<step>Update the main function
```go
func main() {
    person := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30, Email: "alice@example.com"}
    fmt.Println(person.Greet())
}
```
</step>

This will now output: `Hello, my name is Alice, I'm 30 years old, and my email is alice@example.com.`

The changes include:
1. Adding the `Email` field to the Person struct
2. Modifying the `Greet` method to include the email
3. Updating the main function to provide an email when creating a Person instance
