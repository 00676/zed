                    Nathan joined GitHub in late 2011 to build the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom text editor</a>, and
                    he led the Atom team until 2018. He also co-led development of <a
                        href="https://teletype.atom.io">Teletype for Atom</a>, pioneering one of the first production
                    uses of conflict-free replicated data types for collaborative text editing. He's been dreaming about
                    building the world’s best text editor since he graduated from college, and is excited to finally
                    have
                    the knowledge, tools, and resources to achieve this vision.

                    Antonio joined the Atom team in 2014 while still in university after his outstanding open source
                    contributions caught the attention of the team. He later joined Nathan in architecting <a

                        Atom</a> and researching the foundations of what has turned into Zed. For the last two years,
                    he’s
                    become an expert in distributed systems and conflict-free replicated data types through the
                    development of a real-time, distributed, conflict-free database implemented in Rust for <a

                    Max joined the Atom team in 2013 after working at Pivotal Labs. While driving Atom towards its 1.0
                    launch during the day, Max spent nights and weekends building <a
                        href="https://tree-sitter.github.io">Tree-sitter</a>, a blazing-fast and
                    expressive incremental parsing framework that currently powers all code analysis at GitHub. Before
                    leaving to start Zed, Max helped GitHub's semantic analysis team integrate Tree-sitter to support
                    syntax highlighting and code navigation on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>.
