    <p class="mt-5 leading-7">Modern text editors have forgotten the core tentants of software â€“ speed and reliability first, features second.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 leading-7">While we are building Zed from the ground up built for collaboration, we are putting in the time to ensure every feature we build is performant and rock solid.</p>
    <p class="mt-5 leading-7">New software tends to overpromise and underdeliver&mdash;Our goal with Zed is to start small and impress with a singular focus on developer experience.</p>
